# Project objective
  The objective of this project is to create a dynamic and professional online portfolio that effectively showcases my skills and experience as a data analyst. By utilizing a single-page application architecture built with React and styled with CSS, the project provides a seamless user experience. The portfolio's primary function is to serve as a comprehensive digital resume, highlighting my background in computer science, detailing key projects, and outlining my proficiency in various programming languages, software, and operating systems. The design ensures all information is easily accessible, allowing visitors to explore my qualifications without navigating to new pages.
